# 1 - Who does this notice apply to?

Our website [ExploreGames](https://wnellie.github.io) is intended for use by adults who wish to learn about our products and services, and who wish to purchase, through a user account on our website, subscriptions to access digital content on the mobile applications we make available for download through app stores from time to time (each a “ExploreGames App”). Any feature of the website that permits the input of personal data, for example by placing an order for a paid subscription or subscribing to newsletters or other publications, are only intended for use by an adult and is generally placed in areas of our website directed to adults only.

Each ExploreGames App is intended for use by children under adult supervision.  We do not knowingly process children’s personal data. ExploreGames Apps provide numerous activities and features for children that do not require the processing of personal data.  Any feature of an ExploreGames App that allows in-app purchases is only intended for adults, and is operated by the relevant App Channel Provider (as defined below). 

This notice applies to you when you access, browse and use our website (through various domains) and ExploreGames Apps, join our mailing lists to receive our newsletter communications, and interact with us on the website, our social media pages, by telephone, email and by other means.

ExploreGames Apps are only available for download from app stores made available by authorised app channel providers (for example, Apple’s App Store, Google Play, Amazon  Appstore or such other app store as we may authorise) (an “App Channel Provider”).  If you make any in-app purchases on an ExploreGames App, the privacy notices of the relevant App Channel Provider will also apply in respect of the personal data it controls and processes. 

We strive to comply with the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

# Types of personal data we process

“Personal data” means information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include information where an individual’s identity has been removed (anonymous data).  Throughout this privacy notice we use the term “processing” to refer to all activities involving your personal data, including collecting, handling, storing, sharing, accessing, using, transferring, erasing and disposing of it.

The personal data we receive about you depends on how you interact with us, and whether you are using our website or an ExploreGames App. For this reason, we have distinguished parts of this privacy notice to describe our data protection practices in relation to our website and ExploreGames Apps. 

## Website

Typically, we process the following kinds of personal data when you use our website:

- Identity and Contact Data includes your name, email address, country of residence, authentication token for social media accounts and any personal data provided when contacting us, and in respect of educators only, the school you are affiliated with, your role/job title, class (grade) type and the city or town and country where your school is located;

- Profile Data includes your email address, password (which we pseudonymise), login and user account details, preferences, subscriptions purchased, gift codes and their expiry dates, the online channel through which you created your user account, feedback and survey responses;  

- Transaction Data (Website) includes details about payments from and to you and other details of digital content you have subscribed for with us.  However, this does not include payment card or bank details, as you provide this information directly to the secure payments service providers we make available to you on our website;

- Technical Data (Website) may include internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, country and language, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access our website; 

- Usage Data (Website) includes information about how you use our website such as the services you view or search for, page response times, download errors, length of visits and page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks and mouse-overs), traffic data, web logs and other communication data and the resources that you access; and

- Marketing and Communications Data includes your preferences in receiving electronic newsletters and marketing communications from us and your communication preferences.

## ExploreGames Apps: 

Typically, we process the following kinds of personal data when you use an ExploreGames App:

- User Account Data includes your email address, the online channel through which you created your user account, country of residence, subscriptions purchased, gift codes and their expiry dates, and in respect of educators only, your name, the school you are affiliated with, your role, class (grade) type and the city or town and the country where your school is located;

- Transaction Data (App) relates to your making of an in-app purchase on an ExploreGames App. However, your App Channel Provider only provides us with aggregated information so that we know how many users purchase content for ExploreGames Apps via the App Channel Provider, but we do not know the actual identity of those users (including you).  Please consult your App Channel Provider’s privacy notices for information on how they process this type of personal data;

- Technical Data (App) except as described below in respect of our older apps, ExploreGames Apps do not collect your device ID. Instead, we create an anonymous ID in respect of your device, which is a random alphanumeric value but not linked to a device ID, so that we know generally the time zone setting and location, country and language, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices used to access ExploreGames Apps, but not specifically relating to you or your device; 

- Usage Data (App) except as described below in respect of our older apps, ExploreGames Apps do not collect your device ID. Instead, we create an anonymous ID in respect of your device, which is a random alphanumeric value but not linked to a device ID, so that we know generally (but not specific to you) information on use of an ExploreGames App, length and frequency of use, content use (e.g. pages, game play or video watched), information regarding the volume and status of data transmission, page interaction information, activity completion information, click-through statistics, and the date and time users access certain parts of an ExploreGames App; 

## Website and ExploreGames Apps: 

We also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for various purposes.  Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website or ExploreGames App feature. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.  

We do not collect any special categories of personal data about you (this is personal data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership; genetic data; biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual or data concerning health or sexual orientation).  Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under our [ExploreGames Terms](https://www.ExploreGamesInc.com/terms) and you do not provide that personal data when requested, you may not be able to subscribe for or use some of our products or services. We will let you know at the time of collecting personal data from you whether you must provide the personal data in order to receive any of our products or services, and whether the provision of personal data requested by us is optional.

Under certain circumstances, you may have the following rights:

- **Access.** You have the right to request a copy of your personal data we control.

- **Correction.** You can request to have any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we control corrected.

- **Erasure.** This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.  You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your personal data unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.  We may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, following our receipt of your request.

- **Object.** You may object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and you wish to object to processing on this ground because you consider it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms.  You also have the right to object where we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your personal data which override your rights and freedoms.

- **Restriction.** You can ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want us to establish its accuracy; (ii) where you consider our use of the personal data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the personal data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your personal data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

- **Data portability.** You can ask us to provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. This right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to process or where we processed the personal data to perform a contract with you. If you have a user account or an educator account with us, we provide a facility to download certain of the personal data we hold about you.

- **Withdraw consent.** If you provided your consent to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you wish to withdraw your consent, we will take steps to ensure we no longer process your personal data for the purpose(s) you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal.

- **Exercising your rights:** In order to exercise one or more of your rights in respect of your personal data, please contact us in writing using the information provided in the Contact us section below.
