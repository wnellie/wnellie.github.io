We are parents who believe games are an effective way to augment your child's formal education, whether at school or at home.

We aspire to develop games that sit at the intersection of educational + fun, and meet the high bar set by parents, teachers, caregivers, and children.

The original inspiration for ExploreGames came from our own experience as parents of two children under 5. We often found ourselves letting our kids play games on our phones, to give us a few moments of peace. We tried many games, but didn't feel great about many of them:

- Intense UI/UX leaves children too excited
- Barely educational (and sometimes, lacked any educational merit)
- Not customized for children's individual interests and learning styles
- Not correlated to the expectations of primary school education (eg. Common Core)
