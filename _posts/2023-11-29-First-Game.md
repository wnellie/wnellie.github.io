Our first game is a card-matching game that teaches children 3 core skills they need as they prepare for primary school.

- English pronunciation
- Image recognition
- Visual memory

This game provides 10 "cardpacks" that cover well-known (and sometimes more obscure) objects in the real and imaginary world. The first 5 cardpacks are:

- Magical Creatures
- Into Space
- Under the Sea
- Cars and Trucks
