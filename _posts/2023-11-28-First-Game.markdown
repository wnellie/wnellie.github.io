Our first game is Memory, a relaxing card-matching game that teaches children how to recognize interesting objects that exist in the real world and in their imaginations.

The v1 update focuses on 5 topics:

1. Bugs
2. Cars and Trucks
3. Into Space
4. Magical Creatures
5. Under the Sea

Have fun, and please feel free to reach out to me for feedback and suggestions!
