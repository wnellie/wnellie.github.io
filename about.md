Explore Games is an independent game company whose mission is to help children explore their world.

We are parents of two children under 5, who deeply care about preparing our kids to walk their own path (and not preparing the path for our kids).

We're also busy professionals who don't always have the mental energy to be engaged with our kids every minute of the day, and need to take a pragmatic approach to parenting.
